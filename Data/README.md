# Data

This folder contains the foundational datasets provided by **Markus**, the owner of Marketflash, to help structure and analyze the company's campaign performance. The data was initially collected in two Excel sheets with significant redundancy and inconsistency. These sheets serve as the starting point for the project, where we identified key data elements for designing a normalized database and structured dashboard.

### Files Included:
1. **marketflash_employee_data_2023.xlsx**: Contains information on employees, including fields like employee ID, name, department, and supervisor relationships.
2. **marketflash_marketing_data_2023.xlsx**: Contains raw marketing campaign data, including details on campaign performance metrics across channels, locations, and audiences.

### Purpose
These files provided the basis for:
- Identifying redundancy and inefficiencies within the current data structure.
- Designing a normalized Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) to eliminate redundancy and streamline data organization.
- Building an SQL database that will store and manage data for efficient analysis and reporting.

### Next Steps:
- Conduct interviews with Markus to understand business requirements and prioritize metrics.
- Use this data to design the ERD and define table structures, which will be implemented in SQL with constraints, relationships, and test data.
