# MarketFlash Project Presentation

This video presentation provides an overview of the MarketFlash project, detailing the steps taken to transform raw, redundant data into a structured database and an interactive dashboard. The presentation is designed to give Markus and his team a clear understanding of how the data was organized and how the final dashboard meets their analytical needs.

### Presentation Outline:
1. **Initial Data Review**: Overview of the original datasets, highlighting data redundancy and the need for structuring.
2. **Database Design**: Explanation of the Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD), illustrating how data normalization reduced redundancy and improved data consistency.
3. **Dashboard Walkthrough**: Demonstrates the final Tableau dashboard, with key features including KPI metrics, interactive visualizations, and filters for drilling down by Channel, Location, Audience, and Campaign Type.
