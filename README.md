# MarketFlash Project

Welcome to the **MarketFlash Project** repository! This project was created to provide **Markus** and his team at **MarketFlash** with a structured database and an insightful Tableau dashboard for analyzing marketing campaign performance. The project journey includes data restructuring, database design, and dashboard visualization to help MarketFlash make data-driven marketing decisions.

## Project Structure

This repository contains the following folders, each representing a key step in the project:

### [Data](./Data)
Contains the foundational datasets provided by Markus. These Excel files contain employee and marketing data with redundancy, which served as the starting point for database normalization.

### [ERD](./ERD)
This folder includes the Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) for the MarketFlash database. The ERD was designed after discussions with Markus to eliminate redundancy and create a normalized structure.

### [Mockup-Design](./Mockup-Design)
Here, you'll find the initial mockup design of the dashboard. This design was created following meetings with Markus to understand his specific requirements and identify the KPIs that would be most beneficial for MarketFlash's data analysis needs.

### [SQL](./SQL)
This folder includes SQL files used to set up and test the MarketFlash database:
- **Create.sql**: Script to create tables with specified constraints and relationships.
- **Insert.sql**: Script to insert sample data into the tables.
- **Join.sql**: Script to test relationships between tables using JOIN statements.

### [Viz-Dashboard](./Viz-Dashboard)
Contains the final Tableau dashboard that provides insights into campaign performance across various dimensions. The dashboard includes KPIs, visualizations, and filters to enable detailed analysis by channel, location, audience, and campaign type. You can explore the live dashboard on Tableau.

### [Presentation](./Presentation)
This folder holds the final video presentation of the project. The presentation walks through the project steps, from the initial data structure to the final dashboard.
